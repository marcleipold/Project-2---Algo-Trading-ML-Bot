# Project-2---Algo-Trading-ML-Bot
## Algorithmic and Machine Learning Trading Bot

Instructions:
You have the following ideas for your project:
* Compare two or more machine learning models for solving a predictive task.
* Use natural language processing (NLP) to draw insight from written or spoken language.
* Deploy a machine learning model in Amazon SageMaker as an API.
* Deploy a robo advisor thatâ€™s powered by Amazon Lex.
* Use machine learning to build a sophisticated algorithmic trading bot.

Overview:

For this project Marc, Jerami and I chose to make an Algo trading bot that is optimized using a Deep Learnign Neural Network to answer a fundamental question:
Using the same data parameters, Is it better to use a single indicator or many indicators for a trading bot and will Deep Learning have an effect on the outcome? What about including Sentiment analysis as an indicator?
To answer these questions we put together the following plan:
* Choose our single indicator candidate and our multiple indicator candidates and build out functions to facilitate feeding any data to make our training and testing data sets.
* Make a Deep Learning Neural Network model, as a function, to feed our preprocessed, trained and tested data sets in to.
* Get Sentiment analysis from tweets on twitter to see if there is any correlation with sentiment and market swings.
* Finally we will put all of this together into a trading bot to trade our predicted signals from the Deep Learning models that are trained on our indicators.

## Our proccesses and Data cleaning:
Marc was in charge of Sentiment analysis

## Vader Sentiment Analysis
For my part of the algo trading bot, I decided to create a Sentiment analysis of Tweets referencing Bitcoin during the period of February 2021 to August 2021. For this project, I decided to use the Vader library to perform sentiment analysis on a set of tweets about the hashtag #BTC.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

- pandas
- nltk
- hvplot
- 
To install the required packages, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install pandas nltk hvplot
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the vader_sentiment_analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each cell in the notebook to perform the sentiment analysis
4. The final result of the analysis will be saved to a CSV file and visualized in a histogram plot


### Data
The data used for this analysis is a set of tweets about the hashtag #BTC. The tweets were collected using the Twitter API and pre-processed to remove irrelevant information.

### Sentiment Analysis with Vader
The Vader library is used to perform sentiment analysis on the text data. The library uses a lexicon of words and emoticons to determine the sentiment of a given text. The resulting sentiment scores are reported as negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores, where the compound score is a normalized score between -1 and 1 that indicates the overall sentiment of the text.

### Visualizing the Results
The results of the sentiment analysis are visualized using the hvplot library. The histogram plot shows the distribution of the Vader compound scores for each date. This provides an overall picture of the sentiment towards the hashtag #BTC on different dates.

### Conclusion
Vader Sentiment Analysis is a quick and effective way to determine the sentiment of a given text. This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on a set of tweets about the hashtag #BTC and visualize the results.
